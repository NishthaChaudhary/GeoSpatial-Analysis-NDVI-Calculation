# GeoSpatial-Analysis-NDVI-Calculation

Dataset used: Dataset downloaded from AWS S3:http://landsat-pds.s3.amazonaws.com/c1/L8/042/034/LC08_L1TP_042034_20170616_20170629_01_T1/LC08_L1TP_042034_20170616_20170629_01_T1_B4.TIF

# Data Inspection and Visualiaztion
Downloaded two datasets- Band 3 and Band 4 dataset of Somania location. Inspected the dataset and vizualize Band 3 and Band 4 plot.

# NDVI calculation- Diiference in Vegetation cover Analysis
We then downlaoded the dataset of the same coordinate for different timestamp, one from 2017 and one from 2016 and calculated NDVI for each 
dataset and compared the difference in vegetation cover during the year gap.
